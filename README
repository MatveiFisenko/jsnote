Web frontend for http://www.evernote.com.
Test version linked with sandbox.evernote.com is here: http://jsnote.opensa.ru.

Current state: alpha.

The main idea is to build a frontend that is very fast and easy to use.

Technology.
Now it uses simple php backend layer to communicate with evernote services.
But I like very much an idea to use only javascript and nothing more to get/send data to evernote.

Currently it can not be done because javascript thrift implementation do not support binary protocol (the only one evernote supports).
So we need first to send data via ajax to our php layer, it converts it to binary format, send to evernote, gets data from it and sends it back to our frontend.

When binary protocol will be implemented, it will be possible to send data from browser directly to evernote.
So, this frontend will require no server-side processing and will exist only as "simple" html file.


How to run on own server.

You need to configure apache like this:
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName jsnote.com
	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

	DocumentRoot /path/to/jsnote

	#edam php proxy
	<Directory  /path/to/jsnote>
		php_admin_value mbstring.func_overload 0
	</Directory>

	#oauth requests proxy
	SSLProxyEngine On
	ProxyPass /evernote/oauth https://sandbox.evernote.com/oauth
</VirtualHost>

Apache mod_ssl, mod_proxy, mod_proxy_http should be enabled.

Put tiny_mce files in lib/tiny_mce folder. I use 3.9.2 version. No modifications needed.

That's all.


How it works.
We proxy auth requests via SSLProxyEngine, so auth requests are send by apache directly to evernote servers.
We proxy data requests via our php backend, so data is send by php script to evernote servers.
